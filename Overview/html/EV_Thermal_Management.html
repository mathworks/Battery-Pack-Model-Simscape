<h1>Electric Vehicle Thermal Management</h1>
<!--introduction-->
<p>This example models the thermal management system of a battery electric vehicle. The system consists of two coolant loops, a refrigeration loop, and a cabin HVAC loop. The thermal load are the batteries, powertrain, and cabin.</p>
<p>The two coolant loops can be joined together in serial mode or kept separate in parallel mode using the 4-way valve. In cold weather, the coolant loops are in serial mode so that heat from the motor warms the batteries. If necessary, a heater can provide additional heat. In warm weather, the coolant loops remain in serial mode and both the batteries and the powertrain are cooled by the radiator. In hot weather, the coolant loop switches to parallel mode and separates. One loop cools the powertrain using the radiator. The other cools the batteries using the chiller in the refrigeration loop.</p>
<p>The refrigeration loop consists of a compressor, a condenser, a liquid receiver, two expansion valves, a chiller, and an evaporator. The chiller is used to cool the coolant in hot weather when the radiator alone is insufficient. The evaporator is used to cool the vehicle cabin when air conditioning is turned on. The compressor is controlled such that the condenser can dissipate the heat absorbed by either or both the chiller and the evaporator.</p>
<p>The HVAC loop consists of a blower, an evaporator, a PTC heater, and the vehicle cabin. The PTC heater provides heating in cold weather; the evaporator provides air conditioning in hot weather. The blower is controlled to maintain the specified cabin temperature setpoint.</p>
<p>This model has three scenarios set up. The drive cycle scenario simulates driving conditions in 30 degC weather with air conditioning on. The vehicle speed is based on the NEDC followed by 30 min of high speed to push the battery heat load. The cool down scenario simulates a stationary vehicle in 40 degC weather with air conditioning on. Finally, the cold weather scenario simulates driving conditions in -10 degC weather, which requires the battery heater and PTC heater to warm up the batteries and cabin, respectively.</p>
